 <h4 class="heading4">Who is A Forex Trader?</h4>
 <h4>A Forex Trader Simply Trades forex....</h4>
 <p class="paragraph">But read further.....
  A currency trader, also known as a foreign exchange trader or forex trader, is a person who trades, buys and/or sells currencies on the foreign exchange.
  Currency traders include professionals employed to trade for a financial firm or group of clients, but they also include amateur traders who trade for their own financial gain either as a hobby or to make a living</p>
  <h4 class="heading4">Participants in Forex</h4>
  <p class="paragraph">It is not only you and I that trades forex. Other big corporations as well do.They include:<strong> Central Banks, Financial Institutions, Hedgers, Speculators and Retail Participants.</strong></p>
  <h4  class="heading4">Forex Basics And Terms</h4>
  <h4  class="heading4">PIP: Point in percentage.</h4>
  <p class="paragraph">The unit of measurement to express the change in value between two currencies is called a “pip.”
    If EUR/USD moves from 1.1050 to 1.1051, that .0001 USD rise in value is ONE PIP.
    A pip is usually the last decimal place of a price quote.
    Most pairs go out to 4 decimal places, but there are some exceptions like Japanese yen pairs (they go out to two decimal places).
    For example, for EUR/USD, it is 0.0001, and for USD/JPY, it is 0.01.
    In EUR/USD EUR is the BASE currency while USD is the quoted currency. The base currency is the currency first pronounced in a currency pair. It is attributed the value 1
    Example in <strong>EUR/USD</strong>, <strong>EUR</strong> is the base currency with the value 1 while <strong>USD</strong> is the quoted currency. Thus we say 1 <strong>EUR</strong>= ……….. <strong>USD</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading4">BID AND ASK</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">The <strong>“bid”</strong> is the price at which you can SELL the base currency.The ask is the price at which you can BUY the base currency.The difference between the bid and ask is called the <strong>SPREAD.</strong>Some brokers make their spreads fixed eg instaforex uses fixed spread of 3.But the best brokers use floating spreads</p>
    <h4  class="heading4">LEVERAGE</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">Leverage involves borrowing a certain amount of the money needed to invest in something.In the case of forex, money is usually borrowed from a broker. Forex trading does offer high leverage eg if you use a leverage of 1:100, it simply means if you deposit $100, your broker can borrow you x100 which is $10,000</p>
    <h4  class="heading4">MARGIN</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">This is simply the amount your forex trader sets aside while you trade or open a position</p>
    <h4  class="heading4">EQUITY</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">is the total amount you have in your trading account adding or subtracting your current trades</p>
    <h4  class="heading4">SLIPPAGE</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">occurs when the forex market fails to carry out your order properly.</p>
    <h4  class="heading4">LOT SIZE</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">Forex is commonly traded in specific amounts called lots, or basically the number of currency units you will buy or sell.The standard size for a lot is 100,000 units of currency, and now, there are also mini, micro, and nano lot sizes that are 10,000, 1,000, and 100 units.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
