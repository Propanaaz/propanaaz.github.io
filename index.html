<h1 class="subheading" >EUR/USD Bears looking for fresh 2021 lows </h1>
<p class="paragraph">The <strong>EUR/USD</strong> pair corrected oversold conditions and traded as high as 1.1382 but could not retain its gains and is ending the week pretty much unchanged around 1.1300.  The American dollar stands as the overall winner heading into the weekend, notably stronger against its high-yielding rivals but also higher vs the safe-haven gold.

 Covid-related concerns and Powell
 Market participants had to deal with loads of noise these last few days, which flooded financial markets with risk-off waves. The first round of concerns was triggered by a newly discovered coronavirus variant named Omicron. South Africa reported it on November 25, and global panic resulted in border closures and restrictive measures. As time went by, however, authorities acknowledged that Omicron had been circulating in Western Europe before the strain was identified.
 
 <p class="paragraph">Fears that the new variant may slow economic progress sent equities sharply lower, although there is a light of hope. Omicron seems more contagious but less aggressive, as cases reported so far are mild. JP Morgan said the variant might be the end of the pandemic, as the virus seems to be following the historical evolution pattern towards an endemic illness. “Omicron could be a catalyst for steepening (not flattening) the yield curve, rotation from growth to value,” the strategists said. Additionally, experts believe that vaccines will still offer protection against severe cases and death.  The WHO remains cautious as there are a lot of unknowns surrounding the new strain, with a clearer picture expected by mid-December.</p>
 
 
 <p class="paragraph">US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, meanwhile, testified on the CARES act before the Senate. Powell noted that inflation had spread more broadly and that the risk of persistent inflation has risen. He added that it's time to remove the term “transitory” to describe price pressures, and the Fed would discuss speeding up tapering in their December meeting, to counter inflation.
 
  Covid-related concerns and Powell’s testimony sent Wall Street nose-diving and helped the greenback to retain its strength.

 <p class="paragraph">Inflation and employment in the eye of the storm
  European data has kept reflecting the Union’s struggle to return to a path of growth, as inflation keeps rallying to record levels. According to preliminary estimates, the German Consumer Price Index reached a record of 6% YoY in November. The figure only confirmed what market participants already knew, as EU inflation stands at a multi-year high. And while the US Federal Reserve has finally shown signs of real concern, the European Central Bank maintains its wait-and-see stand. On Thursday, European policymaker Fabio Panetta said that inflation and the new pandemic wave is endangering the Union’s recovery at an early stage, although earlier this week, he noted that there’s no need to tighten monetary policy to control inflation, driven by temporary factors.</p>  
 
 On Friday, the US published the Nonfarm Payrolls report, which showed that the country added just 210,000 new jobs in November, much worse than anticipated. The unemployment rate contracted to 4.2%, better than the 4.5% expected, while the Participation Rate jumped to 61.8%. The report put mild pressure on the greenback heading into the weekly close, but the impact was quite limited. The US is still 4 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels.
 
 The second week of December will bring updates on already published data, which means the macroeconomic calendar will likely have a limited impact on price action, this could be even more the case considering the upcoming central bank decisions just before the winter holidays.
 
 The EU will publish the final reading of  Q3 Gross Domestic Product, while Germany will release the December ZEW Survey on Economic Sentiment and November final inflation figures. The US will also publish the November Consumer Price Index, which is expected to be downwardly revised to 5.8% YoY from 6.2%.</p>
 <h1 class="subheading">Gold Weekly Forecast: Sellers eye $1750 as fed Stays on tightening path</h1>
 <p class="paragraph">On Tuesday, markets, once again, turned risk-averse after the CEO of Moderna said that current vaccines were likely to be ineffective against the new variant and added that it would take “months before pharmaceutical companies can manufacture new variant-specific jabs at scale.” Gold managed to stage a decisive rebound and climbed above $1,800. However, FOMC Chairman Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks provided a boost to the greenback and forced XAU/USD to erase its daily gains.

  While testifying before the US Senate Banking Committee, Powell said it would be appropriate to consider wrapping up the asset taper a few months sooner than initially planned. Regarding the Omicron variant, Powell said that they need to see more data to assess its potential impact on economic activity. Finally, the chairman noted that it was time to retire the term “transitory” when defining inflation in the US. </p>
  
  <p class="paragraph">On Wednesday, the data from the US revealed that employment in the private sector increased by 534,000. Additionally, the ISM Manufacturing PMI arrived at 61.1 in November, showing that the business activity in the manufacturing sector continued to expand at a robust pace. The Prices Paid component of the PMI survey edged lower to 82.4 from 85.7.
  
    In the absence of high-tier macroeconomic data releases, the dollar didn’t have a hard time outperforming its rivals and XAU/USD slumped to its lowest level since early November at $1,761. Meanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester voiced her support for a quicker taper so the Fed can have the flexibility to change the policy rate sooner if needed. 
    
    The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) increased by 210,000 in November, missing analysts' estimate of 550,000 by a wide margin. Underlying details of the publication revealed that wage inflation, as measured by the Average Hourly Earnings, remained steady at 4.8% on a yearly basis. Nevertheless, investors don't seem to think that the dismal NFP print will alter the Fed's tapering outlook with the US Dollar Index and the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield easily returning to pre-release levels following a knee-jerk reaction.</p>
